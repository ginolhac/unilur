This **Quarto** website is demo of how we can use **unilur** for teaching.

One real example is this [bachelor R intro module](https://basv53.uni.lu) for Life Sciences students.

For students, we want to have slides (`revealjs`) and practicals.
In the later, the Quarto documents are using **unilur** for writing solutions along questions. 
Solutions are within green boxes that we hide for instructions and reveal when practicals are done.
This is acheived by toggle the header variable to `true` from: `show-solution: false`

### Pre-filled template quarto files

The add-on here is generating **Quarto templates** that students can download and start filling up.
They are `.qmd` files identical to instructions but where solution chunks are replaced by:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
# write answer here
```
````

This is not done by **unilur** at all, but this some custom setup from regular [Quarto Websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)

This is stated as `type` in the main config file `_quarto.yml`:

``` yaml
project:
  type: website
  pre-render: create-template-yml.R # key hook before quarto render
  render:
    - "*.qmd"
    - "!*_answer.qmd"
```

Then the key part is calling a R script `create-template-yml.R` that will:

- Generate the quarto templates.
- Generate a yaml file from those templates.

Then the custom listing is shaped by the `templates-listing.ejs` where we specify the table look and appearance.

It is called in the listing page `practicals.qmd` that first list the practicals (classic listing) then the templates (custom).

Usually, we have projects along practicals, you can add them in line 3:

``` r
target_folder <- c("practicals", "projects")
```

### Template headers

Right now, the quarto headers for templates will be formatted as follows:

``` yaml
---
title: "Practical chickens"
date: today
author: "Your name"
format: html
embed-resources: true
---
```

`embed-resources: true` because otherwise as a teacher you receive sad HTML without any libs.

The date is reported from original practical, kept as `today` if set but then the displayed date is 1st January 1970 in `practicals.html`. We advise setting a meaningful date in ISO8610 format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
If date is missing, current day is set.

Of note, practicals with a `draft: true` variable are ignored.
